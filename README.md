# Feature Selection, Model Selection, and Tuning (FMST) - Employee Promotion Eligibility Prediction at Likoma Company - By David Salako.

## Background and Context:

Employee Promotion means the ascension of an employee to higher ranks, this aspect of the job is what drives employees the most. The ultimate reward for dedication and loyalty towards an organization and HR team plays an important role in handling all these promotion tasks based on ratings and other attributes available.

The HR team in Likoma company stored data of promotion cycle last year, which consists of details of all the employees in the company working last year and also if they got promoted or not, but every time this process gets delayed due to so many details available for each employee - it gets difficult to compare and decide.

So this time HR team wants to utilize the stored data to make a model, that will predict if a person is eligible for promotion or not.
